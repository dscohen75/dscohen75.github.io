The Paycheck Protection Program was initiated in April 2020. Administered by the Small Business Association (SBA), these forgivable loans were meant to relieve small businesses in America some of the potentially devastating strain imparted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Congress appropriated $649 billion for this program, and over 500 million loans were granted, at an average amount of $111,000.

In the rush to push out the money to businesses that needed it, a lot of concern arose around whether these loans were applied for legitimately and handed out fairly. Clearly they were not in every case. Since my physical therapy practice was a recipient of a small PPP loan, when I found that the SBA and the U.S. Treasury released their data from the PPP loans that had been granted, I felt it was my duty to dig in and see whether any unsavory patterns emerged.

The full analysis can be found in [the Medium article](https://medium.com/@debbiecohen_22419/state-of-the-paycheck-protection-program-loans-a-checkup-10289751ee25), and the [code here](https://github.com/dscohen75/BW2).

To your small business prosperity, if you so choose...
