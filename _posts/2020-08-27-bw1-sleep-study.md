I've always been somewhat of a self-described sleep zealot. 

During my 15-year career as a physical therapist I can safely say that over half of all of my clients had some variety of sleep disturbance as a major factor driving their primary complaint.

Now as I transition into the world of data science, it's only appropriate that for Build Week 1 at Lambda School I found a dataset from a study that may help people get better sleep.

Here are links to the full [article on Medium](https://medium.com/@debbiecohen_22419/how-can-our-daily-habits-influence-sleep-and-fatigue-levels-d7f94b4fa212), and to the [code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1I3QNnvDuGxF1wHFO7Bq_PjzN0IM-R7kN?usp=sharing). 


Enjoy, and may you enjoy good sleep and sweet dreams!
